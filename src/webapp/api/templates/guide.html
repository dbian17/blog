            This website is not meant to be a universal source of truth, because food taste, much like art or music taste, is subjective. 
            I've listed a bunch of core principles below to hopefully paint a better picture of what I look for in a restaurant, but they are 
            no means a strict ruleset. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            If you agree with at least some of these points, then I hope this body of work serves you well.
            If not, then I don't think we can be friends! (haha jkjk...but not really)
        </div>

        <ul id="tenets-list">
            <li> 
                There is no such thing as a 10: Perfection does not exist. Much like chasing an asymptote, 
                we can get closer and closer to it, but we'll never quite get there.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Texture over flavor: Would you rather have perfectly seasoned chicken but it's dry af or unseasoned chicken with perfect texture? 
                Im taking the bland chicken all day everyday and I'm dying on that hill. Texture is just so much harder to nail than flavorings imo. 
                More often than not, if something tastes plain, all you need to do is add salt. You don't even need extra sauces or spices. 
                Meanwhile, good luck trying to make your well-done steak more tender.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Sauce should not be the main attraction: Sauce should enhance an already good dish or add another dimension of flavors. 
                It should never be the main driving force. If something absolutely needs sauce to taste good (looking at you Raising Cane's), 
                then it wasn't very good to begin with. I will make an exception for braises since, well, that's their whole premise haha.
                
            </li>
            <li> 
                Portion sizing is overrated: This is not a 'worth it' guide. I'm not going to rate a place higher because the portions are larger 
                if the food is still mid. Now if the place has good food AND serves a lot of it? That's a different story haha.
                Quite frankly though, most standard portions at restaurants aren't enough for me so I'm not going to dock points, 
                because I didn't come out full
